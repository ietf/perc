<abstract>
<t>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to
be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing
strong end-to-end security guarantees. This document defines SRTP
procedures that use two separate but related cryptographic operations
to provide hop-by-hop and end-to-end security guarantees.  Both the
end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithms can utilize an
authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or take advantage
of future SRTP transforms with different properties.

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Cloud conferencing systems that are based on switched conferencing
have a central Media Distributor device that receives media from
endpoints and distributes it to other endpoints, but does not need to
interpret or change the media content.  For these systems, it is
desirable to have one cryptographic key from the sending endpoint to
the receiving endpoint that can encrypt and authenticate the media
end-to-end while still allowing certain RTP header information to be
changed by the Media Distributor.  At the same time, a separate
cryptographic key provides integrity and optional confidentiality for
the media flowing between the Media Distributor and the endpoints.
The framework document <xref target="I-D.ietf-perc-private-media-framework"/>
describes this concept in more detail.
</t>
<t>This specification defines an SRTP transform that uses the AES-GCM
algorithm <xref target="RFC7714"/> to provide encryption and integrity for an RTP
packet for the end-to-end cryptographic key as well as a hop-by-hop
cryptographic encryption and integrity between the endpoint and the
Media Distributor. The Media Distributor decrypts and checks
integrity of the hop-by-hop security. The Media Distributor MAY
change some of the RTP header information that would impact the
end-to-end integrity. In that case, the original value of any RTP
header field that is changed is included in a new RTP header extension
called the Original Header Block. The new RTP packet is encrypted with the
hop-by-hop cryptographic algorithm before it is sent. The receiving
endpoint decrypts and checks integrity using the hop-by-hop
cryptographic algorithm and then replaces any parameters the Media
Distributor changed using the information in the Original Header Block
before decrypting and checking the end-to-end integrity.
</t>
<t>One can think of the double as a normal SRTP transform for encrypting
the RTP in a way where things that only know half of the key, can
decrypt and modify part of the RTP packet but not other parts,
including the media payload.
</t>

</t>
<t>Terms used throughout this document include:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Media Distributor: media distribution device that routes media from
one endpoint to other endpoints</t>
<t>end-to-end: meaning the link from one endpoint through one or

</section>

<section anchor="cryptographic-context" title="Cryptographic Context">
<t>This specification uses a cryptographic context with two parts:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>An inner (end-to-end) part that is used by endpoints that originate and
consume media to ensure the integrity of media end-to-end, and</t>
<t>An outer (hop-by-hop) part that is used between endpoints and Media
Distributors to ensure the integrity of media over a single hop and to
enable a Media Distributor to modify certain RTP header fields. RTCP
is also handled using the hop-by-hop cryptographic part.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The RECOMMENDED cipher for the hop-by-hop and end-to-end algorithm is
AES-GCM.  Other combinations of SRTP ciphers that support the
procedures in this document can be added to the IANA registry.
</t>
<t>The keys and salt for these algorithms are generated with the following
steps:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Generate key and salt values of the length required for the combined
inner (end-to-end) and outer (hop-by-hop) algorithms.</t>
<t>Assign the key and salt values generated for the inner (end-to-end)
algorithm to the first half of the key and the first half of the
salt for the double algorithm.</t>
<t>Assign the key and salt values for the outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm
to the second half of the key and second half of the salt for the
double algorithm. The first half of the key is referred to as the
inner key while the second half is referred to as the outer key.
When a key is used by a cryptographic algorithm, the salt used is
the part of the salt generated with that key.</t>
<t>the SSRC is the same for both the inner and out outer algorithms as
it can not be changed.</t>
<t>The SEQ and ROC are tracked independently for the inner and outer
algorithms.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Obviously, if the Media Distributor is to be able to modify header
fields but not decrypt the payload, then it must have cryptographic
key for the outer algorithm, but not the inner (end-to-end) algorithm.
This document does not define how the Media Distributor should be
provisioned with this information.  One possible way to provide keying
material for the outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm is to use
<xref target="I-D.ietf-perc-dtls-tunnel"/>.
</t>

<section anchor="key-derivation" title="Key Derivation">
<t>In order to allow the inner and outer keys to be managed
independently via the master key, the transforms defined in this
document MUST be used with the following PRF, which preserves the
separation between the two halves of the key:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
PRF_double_n(k_master,x) = PRF_inner_(n/2)(k_master,x) ||

PRF_inner_n(k_master,x)  = PRF_n(inner(k_master),x)
PRF_outer_n(k_master,x)  = PRF_n(outer(k_master),x)

</section>

<section anchor="ohb" title="Original Header Block">
<t>The Original Header Block (OHB) contains the original values of any modified
RTP header fields. In the encryption process, the OHB is appended to the RTP
payload.  In the decryption process, the receiving endpoint uses it to
reconstruct the original RTP header, so that it can pass the proper AAD value
to the inner transform.
</t>
<t>The OHB can reflect modifications to the following fields in an RTP header: the
payload type, the sequence number, and the marker bit.  All other fields in the
RTP header MUST remain unmodified; since the OHB cannot reflect their original
values, the receiver will be unable to verify the E2E integrity of the packet.
</t>
<t>The OHB has the following syntax (in ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>):
</t>

<figure align="left"><artwork align="left">
OCTET = %x00-FF

PT = OCTET
SEQ = 2OCTET
Config = OCTET
OHB = [ PT ] [ SEQ ] Config

</artwork></figure>
<t>If present, the PT and SEQ parts of the OHB contain the original payload type
and sequence number fields, respectively. The final &quot;config&quot; octet of the OHB
specifies whether these fields are present, and the original value of the
marker bit (if necessary):
</t>

there have been no modifications from the original header.

<section anchor="encrypt" title="Encrypting a Packet">
<t>To encrypt a packet, the endpoint encrypts the packet using the inner
(end-to-end) cryptographic key and then encrypts using the outer

for repair packets that only does the outer (hop-by-hop) encryption.
The processes is as follows:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Form an RTP packet.  If there are any header extensions, they MUST
use <xref target="RFC8285"/>.</t>
<t>If the packet is for repair mode data, skip to step 6.</t>

<t>Header: The RTP header of the original packet with the following
modifications:</t>
<t>The X bit is set to zero</t>
<t>The header is truncated to remove any extensions (12 + 4 * CC

<t>Payload: The RTP payload of the original packet</t>
</list></t>
<t>Apply the inner cryptographic algorithm to the synthetic RTP packet
from the previous step.</t>
<t>Replace the header of the protected RTP packet with the header of
the original packet, and append an empty OHB (0x00) to the
encrypted payload (with the authentication tag) obtained from the
step 4.</t>
<t>Apply the outer cryptographic algorithm to the RTP packet.  If
encrypting RTP header extensions hop-by-hop, then <xref target="RFC6904"/> MUST
be used when encrypting the RTP packet using the outer
cryptographic key.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>When using EKT <xref target="I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet"/>, the EKT Field comes
after the SRTP packet exactly like using EKT with any other SRTP
transform.

<section anchor="relay" title="Relaying a Packet">
<t>The Media Distributor has the part of the key for the outer
(hop-by-hop) cryptographic algorithm, but it does not have the part

cryptographic algorithm and key used to decrypt a packet and
any encrypted RTP header extensions would be the same as those
used in the endpoint's outer algorithm and key.
</t>
<t>In order to modify a packet, the Media Distributor decrypts the
received packet, modifies the packet, updates the OHB with
any modifications not already present in the OHB, and re-encrypts
the packet using the the outer (hop-by-hop) cryptographic key
before transmitting.

<t>
<list style="numbers">

<section anchor="decrypt" title="Decrypting a Packet">
<t>To decrypt a packet, the endpoint first decrypts and verifies using

will still have encrypted data that needs to be decrypted as
specified by the repair algorithm sections.</t>

<section anchor="rtcp-operations" title="RTCP Operations">
<t>Unlike RTP, which is encrypted both hop-by-hop and end-to-end using
two separate cryptographic keys, RTCP is encrypted using only the outer
(hop-by-hop) cryptographic key. The procedures for RTCP encryption
are specified in <xref target="RFC3711"/> and this document introduces no
additional steps.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="use-with-other-rtp-mechanisms" title="Use with Other RTP Mechanisms">
<t>There are some RTP related extensions that need special consideration
to be used by a relay when using the double transform due to the
end-to-end protection of the RTP.  The repair mechanism, when used
with double, typically operates on the double encrypted data and
encrypts them using only the HBH key. This results in three cryptography
operation happening to the repair data sent over the wire.
</t>

<section anchor="rtx" title="RTX">
<t>When using RTX <xref target="RFC4588"/> with double, the cached payloads MUST be the
encrypted packets with the bits that are sent over the wire to the
other side. When encrypting a retransmission packet, it MUST be
encrypted the packet in repair mode.
</t>
<t>A typical RTX receiver would decrypt the packet, undo the RTX
transformation, then process the resulting packet normally by
using the steps in <xref target="decrypt"/>.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="red" title="RED">
<t>When using RED <xref target="RFC2198"/> with double, the primary encoding MAY
contain RTP header extensions and CSRC identifiers but non primary
encodings cannot.
</t>
<t>The sender takes encrypted payload from the cached packets to form
the RED payload. Any header extensions from the primary encoding are
copied to the RTP packet that will carry the RED payload and the other
RTP header information such as SSRC, SEQ, CSRC, etc are set to the
same as the primary payload. The RED RTP packet is then encrypted in
repair mode and sent.
</t>
<t>The receiver decrypts the payload to find the encrypted RED payload.
Note a media relay can do this decryption as the packet was sent in repair
mode that only needs the hop-by-hop key. The RTP headers and header
extensions along with the primary payload and PT from inside the RED
payload (for the primary encoding) are used to form the encrypted
primary RTP packet which can then be decrypted with double.
</t>
<t>The RTP headers (but not header extensions or CSRC) along with PT
from inside the RED payload corresponding to the redundant
encoding are used to from the non primary payloads. The time
offset and packet rate information in the RED data MUST be used
to adjust the sequence number in the RTP header. At this point
the non primary packets can be decrypted with double.
</t>
<t>Note that Flex FEC <xref target="I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme"/> is a
superset of the capabilities of RED.  For most applications, FlexFEC
is a better choice than RED.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fec" title="FEC">
<t>When using Flex FEC <xref target="I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme"/> with
double, the negotiation of double for the crypto is the out of band
signaling that indicates that the repair packets MUST use the order
of operations of SRTP followed by FEC when encrypting. This is to
ensure that the original media is not revealed to the Media
Distributor but at the same time allow the Media Distributor to repair
media.  When encrypting a packet that contains the Flex FEC data,
which is already encrypted, it MUST be encrypted in repair mode
packet.
</t>
<t>The algorithm recommend in <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-fec"/> for repair of video
is Flex FEC <xref target="I-D.ietf-payload-flexible-fec-scheme"/>.  Note that for
interoperability with WebRTC, <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-fec"/> recommends not
using additional FEC only m-line in SDP for the repair packets.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dtmf" title="DTMF">
<t>When DTMF is sent with <xref target="RFC4733"/>, it is end-to-end encrypted and the
relay can not read it so it cannot be used to control the
relay. Other out of band methods to control the relay need to be used
instead.

</section>

<section anchor="recommended-inner-and-outer-cryptographic-algorithms" title="Recommended Inner and Outer Cryptographic Algorithms">
<t>This specification recommends and defines AES-GCM as both the inner
and outer cryptographic algorithms, identified as
DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_128_GCM_AEAD_AES_128_GCM and
DOUBLE_AEAD_AES_256_GCM_AEAD_AES_256_GCM.  These algorithm provide for
authenticated encryption and will consume additional processing time
double-encrypting for hop-by-hop and end-to-end.  However, the
approach is secure and simple, and is thus viewed as an acceptable
trade-off in processing efficiency.
</t>
<t>Note that names for the cryptographic transforms are of the form
DOUBLE_(inner algorithm)_(outer algorithm).
</t>
<t>While this document only defines a profile based on AES-GCM, it is
possible for future documents to define further profiles with
different inner and outer algorithms in this same framework.  For example,
if a new SRTP transform was defined that encrypts some or all of the
RTP header, it would be reasonable for systems to have the option of
using that for the outer algorithm.  Similarly, if a new transform was
defined that provided only integrity, that would also be reasonable to
use for the hop-by-hop as the payload data is already encrypted by the
end-to-end.
</t>
<t>The AES-GCM cryptographic algorithm introduces an additional 16 octets
to the length of the packet.  When using AES-GCM for both the inner
and outer cryptographic algorithms, the total additional length is 32
octets.  If no other header extensions are present in the packet and
the OHB is introduced, that will consume an additional 8 octets.  If
other extensions are already present, the OHB will consume up to 4
additional octets. For packets in repair mode, the data they are
caring is often already encrypted further increasing the size.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
<t>To summarize what is encrypted and authenticated, we will refer to all
the RTP fields except headers created by the sender and before
the payload as the initial envelope and the RTP payload information with the
media as the payload. Any additional headers added by the sender or Media
Distributor are referred to as the extra envelope. The sender uses the
end-to-end key to encrypt the payload and authenticate the payload +
initial envelope, which using an AEAD cipher results in a slight longer
new payload. Then the sender uses the hop-by-hop key to encrypt the
new payload and authenticate the initial envelope, extra envelope and
the new payload. Also to note, the &quot;Associated Data&quot; input (which
excludes header extensions ) to the inner crypto differs from <xref target="RFC7714"/>
construction. This shouldn't typically impact the strength of e2e
integrity given the fact that there doesn't exist header extensions defined
today that needs e2e protection. However, if future specifications define
header extensions that needs e2e integrity protection, the input to inner
transform may be modified to consider including the header extensions.
</t>
<t>The Media Distributor has the hop-by-hop key so it can check the
authentication of the received packet across the initial envelope,
extra envelope and payload data but it can't decrypt the payload as it
does not have the end-to-end key. It can add or change extra envelope
information. It then authenticates the initial plus extra envelope
information plus payload with a hop-by-hop key. The hop-by-hop key for
the outgoing packet is typically different than the hop-by-hop key for
the incoming packet.
</t>
<t>The receiver can check the authentication of the initial and extra
envelope information from the Media Distributor. This, along with the
OHB, is used to construct a synthetic packet which should be
identical to the initial envelope plus payload to one the sender created
and the receiver can check that it is identical and then decrypt the
original payload.
</t>
<t>The end result is that if the authentications succeed, the receiver
knows exactly the payload and initial envelope the sender sent, as
well as exactly which modifications were made by the Media Distributor
and what extra envelope the Media Distributor sent. The receiver does
not know exactly what extra envelope the sender sent.
</t>
<t>It is obviously critical that the intermediary has access to just the
outer (hop-by-hop) algorithm key and not the half of the key for the the
inner (end-to-end) algorithm.  We rely on an external key management
protocol to ensure this property.
</t>
<t>Modifications by the intermediary results in the recipient getting two
values for changed parameters (original and modified).  The recipient
will have to choose which to use; there is risk in using either that
depends on the session setup.
</t>
<t>The security properties for both the inner (end-to-end) and outer
(hop-by-hop) key holders are the same as the security properties of
classic SRTP.
